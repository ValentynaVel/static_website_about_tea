    <h1>Matcha</h1>
    <p>
      Matcha and regular green tea both come from the Camellia sinensis plant,
      which is native to China. However, matcha is grown differently than
      regular green tea. The tea bushes are shielded from sunlight for 20â€“30
      days before harvest. The shade triggers an increase in chlorophyll levels,
      which turns the leaves a darker shade of green and increases the
      production of amino acids.
